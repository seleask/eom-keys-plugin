# eom-keys-plugin
Some useful eom key bindings ported to eog

Binds Next to return, Previous to backspace, and Close to Q. May be useful if you're using a 60% keyboard without arrow keys.

For eog 3.8 and after clone to $XDG_DATA_HOME/eog/plugins/. If XDG_DATA_HOME is unset, try ~/.local/share/eog/plugins/ and create the directory if it doesn't already exist. For more information see [here](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/EyeOfGnome/Plugins).
